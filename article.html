    <h1>On the pleasure of slow mornings</h1>

    <div class="body">
      <p>There is something about waking without an alarm that changes the texture of a whole day. The hours feel longer, not in a tedious way, but in the way a good meal feels longer than a rushed one.</p>
      <p>I have been trying to protect my mornings lately. No phone for the first hour. Just coffee, the window, whatever book is on the table. It is a small discipline but it has made everything else easier to bear.</p>
      <p>The world does not need me at seven in the morning. It barely needs me at nine. There is freedom in admitting that.</p>
