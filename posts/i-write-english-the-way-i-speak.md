I write English the way I speak.

I'm studying English, and this blog is part of that.

My main goal is speaking rather than writing.

People say you don't need to speak English perfectly, so I just write what I think and don't revise much.

It's still hard though.

Thank you, AI agent, for helping with my rough English.
