When I join a new project, I often think,
"Why is this so complex?"

But maybe that's natural.

Nobody knows the final shape of a project before it starts.

We build things step by step,
and every project becomes complex.

Instead of calling everything technical debt,
I want to appreciate the code and architecture
that got us here.

And then improve it little by little.
