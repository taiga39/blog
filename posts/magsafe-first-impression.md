I recently switched from Android to iPhone, and I want to talk about my first impression of MagSafe.

At first, I thought MagSafe was really cool.
Being able to attach things like a wallet or a battery to your iPhone just feels like a boy's dream.
It didn't feel like the iPhone I was used to.

But once I started looking into it, I couldn't find a good option that just holds keys.

And if you try to carry keys, the MagSafe wallet ends up almost as big as a normal wallet.
At that point, you start wondering if you might as well just carry a regular wallet.

It's also not very stylish.
Honestly, MagSafe feels surprisingly uncool.
