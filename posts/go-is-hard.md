Go is hard, but I'm starting to like it.

Before this, I had only used Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I had never used other languages, so I was a bit nervous.

Then I tried [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/) and was surprised.

Go is very explicit about error handling. Every time I write a line of logic, I have to write `if err != nil`. In Ruby, you can often handle errors at the end of a method.

Go feels the same no matter who writes it. I enjoy writing code in Ruby, but it feels like it has an artistic side. So it sometimes feels difficult to read other people's code.

So I'm excited to use Go in a new project.
